# Decision Engine - Recognise Bank

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Node 12.0.0 or up. We recommend upgrading to the LTS version of NodeJS available at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). You can also use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

## Quick Start
